UKCP Registered Psychotherapist and nutrition and lifestyle therapist, Joanna Oates, was able to help Claire understand that binge eating was connected to a number of very traumatic events since childhood, including sexual assault. Claire shares her powerful story, navigating the emotional landscape, delving into past traumas and finding healthier coping mechanisms. Joanna Oates helps Claire confront her relationship with food, and emotional triggers, highlighting the profound insights and breakthroughs she achieved during therapy.Through innovative therapeutic exercises, including a “food and mood diary” and a cathartic lifeline exercise, which charts weights and dates, Claire discovers the roots of her emotional eating and reclaims control over her life.From a profound journey of self-discovery during the COVID-19 lockdown, to pursuing a newfound culinary passion, Claire's story captures the resilience and brilliance of the human spirit, and power of the client-therapist relationship. This episode is an inspiring exploration of the intersection of trauma, eating disorders, mental well-being, and the joy of cooking. Tune in as we uncover the healing power of self-compassion, personal boundaries, and culinary empowerment, particularly for those with neurodiverse feeding requirements.
