                <p>Many people these days struggle with their relationship with food, their weight and body image.
                    Eating disorders and disordered eating appear in many shapes and forms. I observe that people tend
                    to be on a continuum and may not fit into defined categories.</p>
                <p>Deciding to reach out for help can feel challenging and people frequently worry that they are not
                    'ill enough' for treatment. However research shows that recovery rates are faster with earlier
                    treatment, so it is better not to wait for things to deteriorate.</p>
                <div class="purpleLine"></div>
                <p>So if you answer 'yes' to some of the questions below, the chances are that you could benefit from
                    some professional support.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Are your thoughts dominated by food, weight and body shape?</li>
                    <li>Do you worry you have lost control over how much you eat?</li>
                    <li>Do you think you are fat when other people think you are thin? </li>
                    <li>Are you tired of keeping your eating patterns secret from your family, friends and colleagues?
                    </li>
                    <li>Are you pre-occupied with food, weight and body shape?</li>
                    <li>Are you or those close to you worried about your health?</li>
                </ul>
